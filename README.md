# age and gender predictor web based
 This is a simple web based application. I have used python and html to make up this, also with the help of Flask. You can use the url which Flask gives you and you will need to enter your name in that in the last as like this, "https://something/name". Then you will be redirected to a page where your age and gender would have been predicted. I have used two API's for this purpose. They are:
 * [gender_api](https://genderize.io/)
 * [age_api](https://agify.io/)
